Extra masks and Palettes

I haven't had time to do the screenshots for these ones or add them to the pack, they are included here for now.


Also check this:

Pallette: TU Lavender Crush (Invert Setting on)
H & V: LCD_Effect__Blur_03_HV
Gamma: None
Mask: Magenta Pinball Dot Matrix Realistic

The H&V filter gives the effect of unlit dots.  Try this with other Crush Palettes and Dot Matrix Mask combos!
